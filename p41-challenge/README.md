# Welcome to the Particle41 DevOps Team Challenge

This challenge is for candidates who want to join the Particle41 DevOps team.

It is designed to assess your level of familiarity with common modern
development and operations tools and concepts.

## Summary

We aim to hire software engineers who embrace the DevOps mindset, especially
taking an infrastructure-as-code approach to software and infrastructure
deployment.

This challenge is designed to evaluate your abilities in the following
technologies and concepts:

- Software development (in general), by creating an extremely minimal web
  service.
- Containers, including creating a container container image from scratch and
  publishing it.
- Kubernetes, in particular the AWS cloud-native flavor of Kubernetes (Elastic
  Kubernetes Service).
- Terraform, including writing a module and using it to deploy infrastructure.
- Documentation, including a short blurb about the purpose/contents of your repo
  as well as simple deployment instructions.

This assessment consists of two parts, with an extra-credit section at the end.
The first part asks you to create a small application, containerize it, and then
create a Kubernetes manifest for it. The second part asks you to create a
terraform module to deploy a VPC + EKS cluster, and deploy the application to
it.

## Documentation is MANDATORY

It is mandadory to include documentation for your repository explaining how to
use it.

Imagine that someone with less experience than you will need to clone your
repository and deploy your k8s container, or deploy your terraform
infrastructure.

With that in mind, you must provide all the instructions they will need to do
that successfully. These must include any prerequisites for deployment; mention
of needed tools and links to their installation pages; how to configure
credentials for the tool of your choice; and what commands to run for deploying
your code.

_We want to see your ability to properly document and communicate about your
work with the team._

- Add a `README.md` to the root directory of your project, with instructions for
  the team to deploy the projects you created. Include any notes (purpose, etc.)
  that you might add to the README if this were a real project.
- Publish your code to a public Git repository in a platform of your choice
  (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.), so that it can be cloned by the team.

## A word about generative AI

It is ok to use generative AI to complete this challenge, but we want to be sure
that you know what you're doing.

The acceptance criteria for the solution are clearly defined below. Regardless
of using generative AI, your solution must pass those acceptance criteria. If it
passes, we're ok with it and you'll move on to the next step in the selection
process.

So, this is our advice: if you use generative AI, make sure that your solution
works as expected and passes the criteria as explained below. Don't waste our
time (and yours!) submitting a solution that doesn't work.

# Task 1 - Minimalist Application Development / Docker / Kubernetes

## Tiny App Development: 'SimpleTimeService'

- Create a simple microservice (which we will call "SimpleTimeService") in any
  programming language of your choice: Go, NodeJS, Python, C#, Ruby, whatever
  you like.
- The application should be a web server that returns a pure JSON response with
  the following structure, when its `/` URL path is accessed:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "<current date and time>",
  "ip": "<the IP address of the visitor>"
}
```

## Dockerize SimpleTimeService

- Create a Dockerfile for this microservice.
- Your application MUST be configured to run as a non-root user in the
  container.
- Publish the image to a public container registry (for example, DockerHub) so
  we can pull it for testing.

## Create a k8s manifest for SimpleTimeService

- Create a Kubernetes manifest in YAML format, containing a Deployment and a
  Service, to deploy your microservice on Kubernetes.
- Your Deployment must use your public Docker image from DockerHub.
- DO NOT use `LoadBalancer` as the service type!

## Push your code to a public git repository

- Push your code to a public git repository in the platform of your choice (e.g.
  GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.). MAKE SURE YOU DON'T PUSH ANY SECRETS LIKE
  API KEYS TO A PUBLIC REPO!
- We have a recommended repository structure [here](##Suggested Repo Structure).

## Acceptance Criteria

Your task will be considered successful if a colleague is able to deploy your
manifests to a running Kubernetes cluster and use your microservice.

Assuming that your manifest file is named `microservice.yml`, the command:

```sh
kubectl apply -f microservice.yml # i.e. your manifest file
```

must be the only command needed to deploy your microservice to Kubernetes. Your
application MUST run successfully in Kubernetes.

Other criteria for evaluation will be:

- Documentation: you MUST add a `README` file with instructions to deploy your
  application.
- Code quality and style: your code must be easy for others to read, and
  properly documented when relevant.
- Container best practices: your container image should be as small as possible,
  without unnecessary bloat.
- Container best practices: your application MUST be running as a non-root user,
  as specified in the exercise.

Your task will be considered successful if a colleague is able to deploy your
application to a Kubernetes cluster and it gives the correct response.

# Task 2 - Terraform and AWS: create an EKS cluster

Using Terraform, create the following infrastructure in AWS:

- A VPC with 2 public and 2 private subnets.
- An EKS cluster deployed to that VPC.
- The cluster must have 2 nodes, using instance type `m6a.large`.
- The nodes must be on the private subnets only.

If you prefer, you may use popular modules from the Terraform registry (for
example the
[VPC](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws/latest)
and
[EKS](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws/latest)
modules).

## Push your code to a public git repository

- Push your code to a public git repository in the platform of your choice (e.g.
  GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.). MAKE SURE YOU DON'T PUSH ANY SECRETS LIKE
  API KEYS TO A PUBLIC REPO!
- We have a recommended repository structure [here](##Suggested Repo Structure).

---

## Acceptance Criteria

Your task will be considered successful if a colleague is able to deploy the
infrastructure to an AWS account and the correct resources are created.

```sh
terraform plan
```

and

```sh
terraform apply
```

must be the only commands needed to create the VPC and EKS cluster.

You MUST NOT commit any credentials to the git repository. Instead, provide
instructions in the README about how to authenticate to AWS to deploy the
infrastructure.

Other criteria for evaluation will be:

- Code quality and style: your code must be easy for others to read, and
  properly documented when relevant.
- Terraform best practices: Use variables in your infrastructure root module,
  and provide some good defaults in a `terraform.tfvars` file.

# Notes, Suggestions, and the opportunity to 'show off'!

## Suggested Repo Structure

```
.
├── app <-- app files/directories and Dockerfile go here
└── terraform <-- Terraform files/directories go here (i.e. we will run `terraform plan`/`terraform apply` from here)
```

## Extra Credit!

**THIS SECTION IS _COMPLETELY OPTIONAL_! THERE IS NO PENALTY FOR IGNORING
THIS!**

Are you an overachiever? Demonstrate your mastery of cloud-native IaC tooling by
doing any of these:

- Additional Terraform code to actually deploy the 'simpletimeservice' container
  image to the EKS cluster.
- Additional Terraform code to use the Helm provider and any public helm chart
  to install any standard devops tooling (such as Prometheus).
- Updates to the Kubernetes manifest to utilize best practices (e.g. pod CPU and
  memory limits).
- A sidecar container of some kind, such as fluentbit.
- Code to initialize and use a remote Terraform backend (S3 and DynamoDB) for
  state and locking instead of a local `.tfstate` file.
- Create a simple CI/CD pipeline (Github Actions, Bitbucket Pipelines, GitLab
  CI, etc.) to publish your container image to the container registry, and
  commit the configuration to your solution repo.
- Anything else that might demonstrate that you know what's up.
